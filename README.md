# web-scraper
Some trial webscraping Python scripts.

This was just for some playing around with web scraping using Python.
Although it is really cool stuff to do, I found I was spending more time
dealing with HTML/CSS than Python. Since my goal was increasing my Python
knowledge and experience, as interesting as it was, I abandoned this work.
Hence, the state you find things in.
